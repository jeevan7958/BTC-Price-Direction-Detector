> **Research Goal:** Investigate whether Deep Learning architectures (Transformers/LSTMs) can statistically outperform linear baselines in forecasting short-term Bitcoin volatility.

## Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the **daily directional movement** (Up/Down) of Bitcoin. 

Unlike typical "price prediction" tutorials that overfit data, this project rigorously benchmarks complex Neural Networks against simple statistical baselines to test the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**.

### The "Brain" Behind the App
* **Architecture:** Custom Transformer Encoder with Multi-Head Attention.
* **Input Features:** 14-day window of Stationary Returns & Volume Changes.
* **Interpretability:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to visualize feature importance.

## Key Research Findings

After extensive training and hyperparameter tuning, the results yielded a fascinating insight into financial markets:

1.  **The "Random Walk" Validation:**
    * **Linear Baseline Error (MAE):** `2.03%`
    * **Transformer Model Error (MAE):** `2.09%`
    * *Conclusion:* The deep learning model performed statistically identically to the linear baseline. This validates the Efficient Market Hypothesis for short-term (<14 days) timeframes, suggesting that price returns are highly stochastic and difficult to predict using price history alone.

2.  **Feature Importance (SHAP):**
    * Analysis revealed that **Volume (lagged by 2 days)** was the most significant predictor of volatility, suggesting a delayed market reaction to massive trading events.

3.  **Lag Effect:**
    * The deployed model exhibits a ~1-day lag during sharp trend reversals, confirming that the Transformer relies heavily on recent momentum signals.

* **Preprocessing:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn (MinMax Scaling)
* **Modeling:** TensorFlow / Keras (Transformer & LSTM)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, SHAP
* **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud
